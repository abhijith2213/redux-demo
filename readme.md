# Project Title

This is the project which goes through the basics of redux to new redux-toolkit concepts. There are three categories included in the repository.
In the folder redux-demo, it includes the basic pure redux usage with javascript. And in the folder redux-tlkit-demo , using of redux toolkit with javascript and finally 
in the folder react-redux-demo its how to use redux toolkit along with react. By going through all these we can understand the diffrence and how the complexity decreased when coming to use
redux-toolkit. And Vite is used along with React as the development tool.
